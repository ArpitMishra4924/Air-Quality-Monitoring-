            <h1>Air Quality Index(AQI)</h1>
            <p>An air quality index (AQI) is an indicator developed by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. As air pollution levels rise, so does the AQI, along with the associated public health risk. Children, the elderly and individuals with respiratory or cardiovascular problems are typically the first groups affected by poor air quality. When the AQI is high, governmental bodies generally encourage people to reduce physical activity outdoors, or even avoid going out altogether. When wildfires result in a high AQI, the use of masks such as N95 respirators outdoors and air purifiers incorporating HEPA filters indoors are also encouraged.

                Different countries have their own air quality indices, corresponding to different national air quality standards. Some of these are Canada's Air Quality Health Index, Malaysia's Air Pollution Index, and Singapore's Pollutant Standards Index
                Computation of the AQI requires an air pollutant concentration over a specified averaging period, obtained from an air monitor or model. Taken together, concentration and time represent the dose of the air pollutant. Health effects corresponding to a given dose are established by epidemiological research. Air pollutants vary in potency, and the function used to convert from air pollutant concentration to AQI varies by pollutant. Its air quality index values are typically grouped into ranges. Each range is assigned a descriptor, a color code, and a standardized public health advisory.The AQI can increase due to an increase of air emissions. For example, during rush hour traffic or when there is an upwind forest fire or from a lack of dilution of air pollutants. Stagnant air, often caused by an anticyclone, temperature inversion, or low wind speeds lets air pollution remain in a local area, leading to high concentrations of pollutants, chemical reactions between air contaminants and hazy conditions.</p>

        <h1>What is Air Quality Index ?</h1>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Urban air pollution is rapidly increasing in Indian cities. Different methods have been designed to calculate the air quality index in form of mathematical formula. Many studies have shown association between exposure of the population to air pollutants and its adverse health impact. But the formula designed by CPCB in 2014 is more robust to find out the air quality category. To provide the public, information for air pollution dangers, several governmental and municipal agencies developed air quality indices, as a timely information about the potential changes in air quality. In this paper review of air quality index shows how AQI constitutes as an effective method to estimate air pollution levels and risks and help the government in effective pollution control measures adopted for reduction of emissions from various sources.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The monitoring and evaluation of ambient air quality is the first important step in controlling air pollution. Huge amount of monitoring data often does not convey air quality status to the scientific community, policy makers, regulatory and in particular to the general public in a simple and straightforward manner. In light of the health effects of air pollutants, environmental agencies have been using air quality index (AQI) for public information (about air quality) and data interpretation. Air Quality Index (AQI) of a given area, which is also known as Air Pollution Index (API) [1], [2], [3], [4] or Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) [5], [6], has been developed and disseminated by many agencies in U.S. Canada, Europe, Australia, China, Indonesia, Taiwan, etc. [7], [8]. An “Air Quality Index” may be defined as a single number for reporting the air quality with respect to its effects on the human health [3], [9]. In most elaborate form, it combines many pollutants concentrations in some mathematical expression to arrive at a single number for air quality. This approach for the evaluation of air quality is based entirely on the comparison of measured concentration of pollutants with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Segmented linear functions are used for relating the actual air pollution concentrations (of each pollutant) to a normalized number. As pollutants accumulate the people get exposed to unhealthy pollutant concentration levels which exceed certain acceptable levels.

        Air pollution and its impact to the nearby habitation are the most challenging issues which have to be addressed on top most priority. Air pollutants are generated from different sources including both natural and manmade activities or anthropogenic in to the atmosphere [10], [11]. A number of studies has been carried out and the findings has been implemented worldwide [12], [13], [14], [15]. More focused research has been undertaken based on regional differences with respect to different air pollutants, their characteristics and their role in the air pollution [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. The concentrations of air pollutants and its magnitude varies across different areas which depends upon the types of industrial and other activities which at the end leads to various types of health related hazards [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. For a full proofed solution, a comprehensive monitoring should be carried out as per the national and international guidelines [15]. Air quality dispersion modeling has also a great role to predict the impact of different air pollutants to the nearby areas [26], [27], [28]. Many researches has been carried out by using the mathematical tool to find out the Air Quality Index (AQI) which is very easy to understand and converts different air pollutants concentrations to a single number of an area [29], [30], [31]. On the basis of AQI, an area can be categories as good, satisfactory, moderately polluted, poor, very poor, and severe [32], [33]. AQI has been developed and used in many developed countries since last three decades [1], [34] based on which the ambient atmosphere can be categorized [27], [33]. AQI is used for reporting daily air quality of how clean or polluted the air is and its associated health effects in the area [35]. National Air Quality Index to strengthen air quality information dissemination system for larger public awareness and their participation on air quality management have been initiated by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) Government of India and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). CPCB proposed the breakpoint concentration method for measurement of AQI for individual pollutants is very much robust way to find out the status of air quality. This was also adopted by China and is USEPA concept of break point concentration level which they have adopted since last decade for their development.
        
        Similar type of studies has also been carried out in different areas to find out an overall idea about the air quality status which helps to take immediate corrective measures to control over emissions in the area [19], [36]. In spite of the introduction of cleaner technologies in industries, energy production and transport, air pollution remains a major health risk. Thus, here is a need for timely information about simple change in Pollution levels in industrial/urban area and to maintain the desired level of air quality. Air quality indices are used for local and regional air quality management in metro cities of the world [37]. The AQI (Air Quality Index) is a single number which represents the air pollution level caused by various pollutants. It shows us how clean or polluted our air is focuses on health effects [38], [39]. Recently air quality index (AQI) is launched by prime minister of India and are given in report of central pollution control board [40]. An analysis of the annual and seasonal trends of air quality index of urban and industrial area [41], [42] using multi-instrument approach and air quality indexing [43]. A novel air pollutant index based on the relative risk of daily mortality associated with short - term exposure to common air pollutants [7].
        
        The Air Quality Index (AQI) is an indicator number used to report the hourly or daily air quality in an area or a locality. The primary purpose of AQI is to protect public health, especially the health of sensitive people such as the elderly, children and asthmatics. It is used by regulatory agencies to inform people or the public on how clean or polluted the air in their environment is, and its associated health effect. Pollutant Standard Index is a sub-index of the AQI used to calculate pollution level of each air pollutant. While AQI considers all the pollutants, PSI considers each pollutant [44]. PSI and AQI are important to air quality study because they report the actual concentrations of each air pollutants and their degree of pollution and effects. The quality of air we breathe directly affects our quality of life as study has shown that an average human being requires about 12 kg of air each day [45]. Air quality index is used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to report daily air quality conditions to the public so that sensitive populations can take precautionary measure. The AQI reporting conditions range from good to hazardous [46].
        
        Although, the use of this approach to some extent helps to maintain a 'desired' environmental quality, it does a little to 'map' periodic degradation in air quality, particularly if the measured values remain below NAAQS. The reason behind this drawback arises from the fact that by providing an upper threshold concentration value in the form of a standard, air quality tends to get categorized either as 'good' or 'bad' depending on whether the standards have been exceeded on not. In reality, however, there are instances where concentration of pollutants become sufficiently high to pose environmental and health problems, but owing to the fact that may not be high enough to cross the threshold value, they are falsely interpreted to represent ‘acceptable’ air quality. Viewed in this backdrop, the present paper attempts to propose an air quality depreciation index that measures deterioration in air quality (with due weightage to the potential capacity of pollutants to affect bio-physical, health and aesthetic attributes) on an 'absolute' environmental quality scale independent of NAAQS. The index makes use of value function curves to determine air quality, an approach conceptually similar to the environmental evaluation system developed by [47] for assessing environmental impacts related to water resource projects. Many researchers have used this concept for determining the ambient air quality.</p>

    <h1>Tips To Save Ourselves From Pollution</h1>
    <h2>Air Pollution: Follow These Preventive Measures To Stay Safe This Festive Season</h2>
    <ol start="1">
        <li><h2>Stay indoors</h2></li>
        <p>Try to limit your time outdoors, especially during peak pollution hours. Stay indoors as much as possible, especially if you have respiratory issues or are sensitive to pollution.</p>
        <li><h2>Keep doors and windows closed</h2></li>
        <p>Keep your doors and windows closed to prevent polluted air from entering your home. Use air purifiers if available.</p>
        <li><h2>Avoid exercise outdoors</h2></li>
        <p>Avoid jogging or exercising outside when air pollution levels are high. If you must exercise, do so indoors or in a well-ventilated area.</p>
        <li><h2>Use masks</h2></li>
        <P>Wear a high-quality mask whenever you need to go outside, especially during festivities when pollution levels tend to be high. N95 or N99 masks are effective in filtering out harmful pollutants.</P>
        <li><h2>Limit use of firecrackers</h2></li>
        <p>Firecrackers are a major contributor to air pollution during festivals. Minimise their use, or ideally avoid using them altogether to help reduce pollution levels.</p>
        <li><h2>Opt for eco-friendly alternatives</h2></li>
        <p>Choose eco-friendly or noiseless firecrackers if you do decide to celebrate with them. These options produce less smoke and noise, minimising the impact on air quality.</p>
        <li><h2>Use public transportation or carpool</h2></li>
        <p>Reduce vehicular pollution by using public transportation or carpooling with friends and family whenever possible. This can help decrease the number of vehicles on the road and, consequently, pollution levels.</p>
        <li><h2>Plant trees</h2></li>
        <p>Participate in tree planting initiatives or support organisations that focus on afforestation. Trees act as natural filters and can help in improving air quality.</p>
        <li><h2>Use air purifiers</h2></li>
        <p>Consider investing in air purifiers for your home. These devices can help remove pollutants from the air indoors and provide cleaner air for your family.

        </p>
        <li><h2>Spread awareness</h2></li>
        <p>Educate your friends, family, and community about the impacts of air pollution and how to prevent it. Raising awareness can lead to collective efforts to reduce pollution and its harmful effects.</p>

While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.
          
          We further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.
